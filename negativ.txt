What a train wreck of a movie!! Absolute garbage. Dumbass story, crap actors, one stupid decision after another, really generic and bad background score. This was disrespectful of the predator franchise. Forget the first two movies (this isn't even on the same continent as far as quality is concerned), even the AVP series was better. And the jokes...OH MY GOD THE JOKES...totally forced and lameass.

Anyone with even a shred of attachment to the legit classic that the first Pred movie was, kindly save yourself the trauma and avoid this one.

Shane black - can you please not direct any movie again? Pretty please?
